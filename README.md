# Custom Cursor

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that creates a custom cursor that follows the mouse.

## Step 1: HTML

The HTML code creates a container div with a class of "container". Inside the container div, there is a div with a class of "cursor", a paragraph with the text "Hey!", and an h1 with the text "My Name Aftab".


## Step 2: CSS

The CSS code sets the container div to be 100% width and height, and the background color to black. The cursor div is set to be 20px wide and 20px high, with a border radius of 50%. The cursor div is also set to be absolute positioned, so that it will follow the mouse.
